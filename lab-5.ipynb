    "We often make predictions on the probability of what the weather would be like for the upcoming day or week. Even if we end up relying on the weather channel to verify our predictions, it doesn't stop us from using informal probability calculations to predict the weather - especially since many weather predictions do not go further than a month into the future. Will it still be over 100 degrees in Phoenix for the next 3 months? Would we still be living in Phoenix in the next 5 years? Will we move before our neighbors move? These are some of the questions we face as residents in Phoenix. We can use variables such as how many days has it already been, how many days of summer are there left, some combination of what we've heard experts say, and what the previous summers were like. We can even look at weather in neighboring cities and states with hope that we would get to see some of the monsoon clouds coming up from Mexico. As the days get hotter and longer without any hope of monsoon season appearing, we then start thinking about the probabilities of us living in Arizona in the next 5 years. \n",

    "\n",
    "The best traveling plans are made when we start with a place that we've been dreaming to go to, what we want to do, and who do we want to go with. Maybe you've been wanting to take the family to Disneyworld, spend a weekend in a cabin with friends, go on a romantic honeymoon in the Bahamas, or take a solo trip to Japan. Dreaming of this part is easy. Now the real question is when is the best time to go? Here, we would have to rely on probabilities to help us come up with the best dates to go on that dream vacation. We would have to consider factors that can help increase the likelihood that we would enjoy our trip the way we want to. Factors such as: What are the busiest travel dates for that location? What activities are happening and which ones are we interested in? What days can our friends and family simultaneously request PTO for? What is our budget? When are the kids go on summer break? What would the weather be like in that location? If you want to take the kids to Disneyworld in Florida, maybe you should avoid dates that fall within hurricane season. If you want that quiet romantic honeymoon, maybe it would be best to avoid busy travel dates. These variable are all used to help us determine the best and most efficient dates for us to choose when planning that dream vacation. "
